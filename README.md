# OTID-FAN (One-Time Digital Identity Verification & Fraud Alert Network)

A hybrid web application that provides digital identity verification and fraud reporting/tracking functionality.

## Project Overview

The project has two main components:

1. **OTID (One-Time Digital Identity Verification)**
   - User registration with name, email, photo, and ID document
   - AI-based face matching for identity verification
   - Generation of unique OTID tokens stored on a simulated blockchain

2. **FAN (Fraud Alert Network)**
   - Form for reporting fraud incidents
   - Secure database for storing fraud reports
   - Association of fraud reports with OTIDs
   - API endpoint to check fraud status of any OTID

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js with React Bootstrap
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Additional Tools**:
  - face-api.js for facial recognition
  - ethers.js for blockchain simulation
  - JWT for authentication

## Quick Start

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/848deepak/OTID-FAN.git
   cd OTID-FAN
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm run install-all
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   PORT=5000
   ```

4. Create the uploads directories:
   ```
   mkdir -p uploads/photos uploads/ids uploads/evidence
   ```

5. Start the backend development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

6. In a separate terminal, start the frontend:
   ```
   cd client
   npm start
   ```

7. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
